# What is Crypto Club?
We're a group at UMD interested in discussing revolutionary software, cryptocurrency, encryption, computer security, decentralization, and open source software.

Anyone that is interested in such topics are welcome! We have no experience level, major, year, or service hour requirements.

## Meetings
We typically meet weekly to discuss news in the world of crypto and any club-wide projects we may have. Although a large portion of our club is based around projects, they are optional and hold no academic weight. All communication is done through Slack.

## Want to join or are interested in learning more?
Request an invite to the Slack by emailing jakson-at-protonmail-dot-com
