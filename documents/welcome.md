# What is Crypto Club?
Crypto Club is a group at UMD interested in discussing interesting software, cryptocurrency/blockchain, encryption, computer security, and decentralized networks. Despite being called Crypto Club, computer cryptography is only part of what we talk about.

Anyone that is interested in technology regarding open source, cryptography, or computer security is welcome! We have no major, year level, or participation hour requirements.

## Meetings
We typically meet on Tuesdays at 6:30pm.

## Want to join or are interested to learn more?
Our club doesn't have a strict registration process, members can simply subscribe to the emailing list obligation-free to see if they are interested, and can attend the meetings they wish to. To start receiving Crypto Club emails, just shoot me a message at jakson(at)protonmail.com with your preferred email address(es).

All announcements (meeting times, important crypto news, etc.) are done through email mailing list, and all general discussion is done in the [Crypto Club lounge on Slack](http://bit.ly/CryptoClubSignup).
