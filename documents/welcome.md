# What is Crypto Club?
Crypto Club is for those interested in discussing interesting software, cryptocurrency/blockchain, encryption, computer security, and decentralized networks. Despite being called Crypto Club, computer cryptography is only part of what we talk about.

Anyone that is interested in technology regarding open source, cryptography, or computer security is welcome! We have no major, year level, or participation hour requirements.

## Meetings
We typically meet on Thursdays at 6:30pm.
