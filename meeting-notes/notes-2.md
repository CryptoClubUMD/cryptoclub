## Schedule
1. Any new people this week?
	* Say names, majors, favorite programming language
2. Anything cool happen over the last week in the crypto world?
3. Password Generation
	* Unfortunately, we live in an imperfect world that uses passwords.
		* Theoretically, we could just sign/encrypt all of our own traffic with keys built into the browser, but we simply didn't develop that way.
		* We can still get pretty good security with strong passwords.
	* No such thing as pure randomness... there's always a seed.
		* The human mind is the worst random number generator out there.
	* Brainflayer: password cracker that thinks like a human.
	* The same password on multiple sites is dangerous.
		* A lot of websites don't seed their passwords in their database, meaning the cryptographic hash is the same.
			* More susceptible to rainbow tables.
			* Attacks that discover your password on one site, and see the same hash on the other, will know the password.
	* RANDOM.org
		* Uses atmospheric radio noise to create random numbers.
		* Not open source
	* As you all know: use symbols, numbers, and upper/lower case letters.
	* Don't use phrases.
	* How to make randomness remember-able?
		* Diceware
			* It could be considered "open source".
			* Random words found by using physical dice.
			* Provides great security and very memorable phrases.
			* Lot of typing.
			* If someone knows you use Diceware, this could slightly decrease security.
		* KeePass(X)
			* Cross-platform, open source
			* Password manager
			* Encrypted using strong master key.
4. Anything anyone else wants to talk about?
5. More permanent location for Crypto Club?
6. Dismissal
