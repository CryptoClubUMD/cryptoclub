# Crypto Club First Meeting

Hey software and crypto enthusiasts! This is your official invite to the first meeting of Crypto Club 2017-18! [Info about who we are](https://github.com/CryptoClubUMD/club-website/blob/master/welcome.md)

The first meeting will be on **Wednesday, September 20th** from **6:30-7:00 PM** in the Kirby Student Center commons.

During the first meeting, we will discuss some crypto news as well as look into posters, the new website (it is currently in the works!), and several other ways to build the club membership.

One important thing to note is that we will no longer use the Slack as the *main* source of information and news. Instead, we will be using an *emailing list*. (If you are receiving this email, you are already on the list.) The Slack will now become the Crypto Club lounge for general discussion.

I hope to see you there!
