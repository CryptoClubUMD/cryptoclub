# Crypto Club #13: Github Workshop and Encrypted Messenger

Since there are midterms this week, I figured it would be best to hold off until next week so we can get some studying done.

At meeting 13, we'll focus on creating and talking about git and GitHub!

[Here](https://github.com/CryptoClubUMD/cryptoclub/blob/master/meeting-notes/f17/meeting-13.md
) are the notes for this meeting.

We will be meeting twice this coming week to make up for fall break and midterms.
Currently the meeting is planned for Monday Nov. 6th, at 6:00 PM in KAML 470 (study room on top floor of library). There will also be another meeting on Thursday, but this hasn't been scheduled yet.

Hope to see you there!
