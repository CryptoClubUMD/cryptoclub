# Crypto Club #14: Starting the Encrypted Messenger

We'll start this Thursday's meeting with a quick refresher on Git for anyone that wasn't at last week's meeting. Then, we'll get started on the Encrypted Messenger project.

The meeting will be in KAML 470 (top floor of library) at 6:30-8:00pm on November 16th, 2017.

Hope to see you there!
