# Crypto Club #12: WPA2 Broken and Starting the Project
We'll move on to discuss some recent computer security news, highlighting the WPA2 "KRACK" documentation. From there, we'll actually work on start designing the OO specifications for our encrypted messenger project.

[Here](https://github.com/CryptoClubUMD/cryptoclub/blob/master/meeting-notes/f17/meeting-12.md) are the meeting notes for this meeting.

Currently the meeting is planned for Thursday Oct. 19th, at 6:30 PM in KAML 480 (study room on top floor of library).

Since this study room has a TV, feel free to bring an HDMI cable to connect!

Hope to see you there!
