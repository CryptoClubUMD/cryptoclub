# Crypto Club #11: Outreach and Club Project
The focus of meeting 11 will be how we as a club can reach out and gain more members! We'll be talking about posters and possibly tabling. From there, we will also look at the preliminary design for our group project, the encrypted instant messaging app!

If you haven't attended any meetings yet, this is a great one to attend if you're interested in doing some academic collaborative coding outside of your normal classes!

[Here](https://github.com/CryptoClubUMD/cryptoclub/blob/master/meeting-notes/f17/meeting-11.md) are the meeting notes for the meeting 11.

Currently the meeting is planned for Thursday Oct. 12th, at 6:30 PM in KAML 470 (study room on top floor of library).

Hope to see you there!
