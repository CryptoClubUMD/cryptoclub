Crypto Club - Meeting Times

Hello everyone,
  If you don't know me, my name is Naseem Farahid and I am the new President of Crypto Club. Jakson has decided to step down because he has various commitments to other crypt related things. He is now co-leading the Duluth-wide cryptocurrency club (Congrats Jakson!). But don't worry, he does intend on coming to all the meetings :)
  As we all are settling into the second semester our schedules have changed from the first semester, gaining unsavory 8:00 AMs (Yuck!) or having only one class on Friday (if so Lucky You!). I will be sending out a google forum to everyone so I can see an appropriate time for us to meet. Though it is not mandatory, I encourage everyone to come to the meetings! Exchange ideas, news, and questions related or not related to the crypto world.

  I hope everyone has an awesome day! If you have any questions or concerns regarding crypto club or have questions regarding myself please feel free to contact me at [farah189@d.umn.edu]
  I am also considering creating a discord channel for Crypto Club.

Sincerely,
Naseem Farahid
