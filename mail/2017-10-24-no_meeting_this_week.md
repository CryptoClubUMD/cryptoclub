# No Meeting this Week
Due to the couple days of fall break, there will not be a meeting this week. If anyone is feeling ambitious, feel free to [start the encrypted messenger project!](https://github.com/CryptoClubUMD/encrypted-messenger)

Next meeting we will focus on setting up GitHubs, crypto news, and design for the encrypted messenger if enough members are present.
