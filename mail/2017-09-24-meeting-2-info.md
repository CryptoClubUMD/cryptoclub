# Crypto Club Meeting No. 9
Hello everyone! Last week's meeting was fantastic!

We were able to introduce ourselves and get to know how each of us values cryptography and related subjects. Didn't come? Feel free to check out the meeting notes [here](https://github.com/CryptoClubUMD/cryptoclub/blob/master/meeting-notes/f17/meeting-8.md)!

We're going to continue onto meeting number 9 to talk more about news in the crypto sphere, and hopefully discuss starting a group project! The meeting 9 agenda is [here](https://github.com/CryptoClubUMD/cryptoclub/blob/master/meeting-notes/f17/meeting-9.md), feel free to do a pull request and add a discussion topic if you'd like.

Also, currently the meeting is planned for Thursday Sept. 28th, at 6:30 PM. Please email me if you think there's a better time for people.

Hope to see you there!
